I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Ocean and Mechanical Engineering, FAU, Florida, US. My academic journey has taken me across several prestigious institutions: I previously worked as a postdoctoral in the Department of Chemical Engineering at IIT Delhi, India, and served as a Research Fellow in the Department of Mathematics at IIT Roorkee, India. I earned my Ph.D. in Mathematics from IIT Roorkee in 2021, following my Masterâ€™s degree (M.Sc.) in Mathematics from Department of Mathematics at Aligarh Muslim University, India. My research interests lie in Applied Mathematics, Computational Fluid Dynamics, Hydrodynamic Stability, and Viscoelastic Flows.
